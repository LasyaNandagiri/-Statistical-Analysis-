# Clinical Data Analysis  
## Study on the Efficacy of Different Treatment Protocols

**Project Type:** Statistical Analysis & Inference  
**Environment:** R / R Markdown  

---

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive statistical analysis to evaluate the **efficacy of different treatment protocols** using clinical study data. The analysis applies **statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and regression techniques** to compare treatment outcomes and assess their effectiveness under controlled experimental conditions.

The project is implemented using **R and R Markdown**, enabling reproducible research and transparent reporting of methodology, results, and interpretations.

## Research Objective
The primary objectives of this study are to:
- Compare multiple treatment protocols and evaluate their effectiveness
- Determine whether observed differences in outcomes are statistically significant
- Apply inferential statistical methods to support data-driven medical conclusions

---

## Dataset Description
- **Domain:** Clinical / Medical Research  
- **Study Design:** Controlled experimental study  
- **Subjects:** Patients assigned to different treatment groups  
- **Key Variables:**
  - Treatment group indicators
  - Patient outcome measures
  - Relevant demographic or clinical covariates

> The dataset is used strictly for academic and analytical purposes.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Imported clinical data into R
- Verified data structure, variable types, and distributions
- Addressed missing or inconsistent values
- Properly grouped and labeled treatment categories

---

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated summary statistics for outcome variables
- Performed group-wise comparisons across treatment protocols
- Analyzed distributions using descriptive plots

Visualization techniques include:
- Box plots
- Histograms
- Density plots
- Group comparison charts

---

### 3. Statistical Analysis & Inference
The following statistical methods were applied:
- Hypothesis formulation (null and alternative hypotheses)
- Confidence interval estimation
- Parametric and non-parametric hypothesis tests (as appropriate)
- Comparison of means across treatment groups
- Regression-based evaluation of treatment effects

All statistical assumptions were evaluated prior to interpretation.

---

### 4. Interpretation of Results
- Statistically significant differences between treatment groups were identified
- Effect sizes were analyzed alongside p-values
- Results were interpreted within the context of study design and limitations

---

## Key Findings
- Certain treatment protocols demonstrated superior outcomes compared to others
- Statistical evidence supports meaningful differences between treatment groups
- Findings highlight the importance of data-driven decision-making in clinical settings

> Detailed numerical results and statistical outputs are documented in the R Markdown report.
